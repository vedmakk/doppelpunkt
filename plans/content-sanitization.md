# Content Sanitization Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for consolidating all content sanitization logic in the editor into a single, maintainable system using Redux Toolkit's listener middleware. The goal is to decouple sanitization from UI components and ensure consistent text handling throughout the application.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - The content sanitization system has been successfully implemented according to this design plan.

## Previous State (Before Implementation)

Previously, sanitization logic was spread across multiple locations and operated at different stages:

### Storage Stage (Writing to Store)

1. `stripVisualIndents`: Removes visual indentation before storing text
2. `computeListEnter`: Processes list-related text transformations
3. (Proposed) Character cleaning for problematic Unicode characters

### Presentation Stage (Reading from Store)

1. `injectVisualIndents`: Adds visual indentation for display purposes
2. Other display-specific transformations

Issues with previous approach:

- Sanitization logic was tightly coupled with UI components
- Multiple places where text transformations occurred
- No clear separation between storage and presentation sanitization
- Difficult to test and maintain sanitization rules
- Risk of applying wrong sanitization at wrong stage

**These issues have been resolved in the new implementation.**

## Implemented Solution

The following design has been successfully implemented:

### 1. Core Architecture

Create a new middleware-based sanitization system:

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/types.ts
export interface SanitizationResult {
  text: string
  cursorPos: number
}

export interface SanitizationContext {
  originalText: string
  originalCursorPos: number
  mode: WritingMode
}
```

### 2. Two-Stage Sanitization System

The system is split into two distinct stages with different responsibilities:

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/types.ts
export interface StorageSanitizer {
  name: string
  sanitize(text: string, context: StorageContext): SanitizationResult
}

export interface PresentationSanitizer {
  name: string
  transform(text: string, context: PresentationContext): TransformResult
}

// Storage sanitizers clean data before storing
export const characterSanitizer: StorageSanitizer = {
  name: 'characterCleaner',
  sanitize: (text, context) => {
    // Clean problematic Unicode characters
    // This runs BEFORE storing in Redux
  },
}

// Presentation sanitizers transform data for display
export const visualIndentSanitizer: PresentationSanitizer = {
  name: 'visualIndent',
  transform: (text, context) => {
    // Add visual indentation for display
    // This runs when SELECTING from Redux
  },
}
```

### 3. Implementation Architecture

#### Storage Stage (Redux Middleware)

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/middleware.ts
import { createListenerMiddleware } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const storageSanitizationMiddleware = createListenerMiddleware()

// Intercept setText actions before they reach the store
storageSanitizationMiddleware.startListening({
  actionCreator: setText,
  effect: async (action, listenerApi) => {
    const result = await storagePipeline.sanitize(action.payload)
    listenerApi.dispatch(setTextInternal(result))
  },
})
```

#### Presentation Stage (Redux Selectors)

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/selectors.ts
import { createSelector } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const selectDisplayText = createSelector(
  [(state) => state.editor.documents[state.mode].text],
  (text) => presentationPipeline.transform(text),
)
```

### 4. Character Sanitizer Implementation

The character sanitizer is a critical storage-stage sanitizer that handles problematic Unicode characters that can cause issues in browser environments, particularly with line handling and visual indentation.

#### Character Sanitizer Specification

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/storage/sanitizers/characterSanitizer.ts

const REPLACEMENTS: [RegExp | string, string][] = [
  // Line Separator Characters
  [/\u2028|\u2029/g, '\n'], // Replace line/paragraph separators with regular newlines
  // \u2028: Line Separator
  // \u2029: Paragraph Separator

  // Zero-Width Characters
  [/[\u200B\u200C\u200D\uFEFF]/g, ''], // Remove zero-width spaces and BOM
  // \u200B: Zero-width space
  // \u200C: Zero-width non-joiner
  // \u200D: Zero-width joiner
  // \uFEFF: Byte Order Mark

  // Whitespace Normalization
  [/\u00A0/g, ' '], // Replace non-breaking space with regular space
  [/\r\n?/g, '\n'], // Normalize Windows/old Mac line endings to \n
]

export const characterSanitizer: StorageSanitizer = {
  name: 'characterCleaner',
  sanitize: (text: string, context: StorageContext): SanitizationResult => {
    if (!text) return { text, cursorPos: context.originalCursorPos }

    let adjustedCursorPos = context.originalCursorPos
    let cleanedValue = text

    for (const [pattern, replacement] of REPLACEMENTS) {
      // For each replacement, we need to:
      // 1. Count how many matches occur before the cursor
      // 2. Calculate how the cursor position changes based on those replacements
      const regex =
        pattern instanceof RegExp ? pattern : new RegExp(pattern, 'g')
      let match

      while ((match = regex.exec(cleanedValue)) !== null) {
        const matchLength = match[0].length
        const replacementLength = replacement.length

        // If the match occurs before the cursor, adjust the cursor position
        if (match.index < adjustedCursorPos) {
          adjustedCursorPos += replacementLength - matchLength
        }
      }

      // Apply the actual replacement
      cleanedValue = cleanedValue.replace(regex, replacement)
    }

    return {
      text: cleanedValue,
      cursorPos: Math.max(0, Math.min(adjustedCursorPos, cleanedValue.length)),
    }
  },
}
```

#### Character Sanitizer Tests

Tests in this project are written using Bun's test framework (bun:test).

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/storage/sanitizers/__tests__/characterSanitizer.test.ts

describe('characterSanitizer', () => {
  const context = { originalCursorPos: 0, mode: 'editor' as const }

  it('handles line separator characters', () => {
    const input = 'Line 1\u2028Line 2\u2029Line 3'
    const expected = 'Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3'
    expect(characterSanitizer.sanitize(input, context).text).toBe(expected)
  })

  it('removes zero-width spaces', () => {
    const input = 'Hello\u200BWorld\u200C!\u200D'
    const expected = 'HelloWorld!'
    expect(characterSanitizer.sanitize(input, context).text).toBe(expected)
  })

  it('normalizes whitespace', () => {
    const input = 'Text with\u00A0nbsp\r\nand\rCRLF'
    const expected = 'Text with nbsp\nand\nCRLF'
    expect(characterSanitizer.sanitize(input, context).text).toBe(expected)
  })

  it('maintains cursor position after basic replacement', () => {
    const input = 'Hello\u2028World'
    const result = characterSanitizer.sanitize(input, {
      ...context,
      originalCursorPos: 7,
    })
    expect(result.cursorPos).toBe(6) // Cursor adjusts for shorter replacement
  })

  it('handles multiple replacements before cursor', () => {
    const input = '\u200B\u200BHello\u2028World'
    const result = characterSanitizer.sanitize(input, {
      ...context,
      originalCursorPos: 8,
    })
    expect(result.cursorPos).toBe(6) // Cursor adjusts for all replacements
  })

  it('handles empty input', () => {
    const result = characterSanitizer.sanitize('', context)
    expect(result.text).toBe('')
    expect(result.cursorPos).toBe(0)
  })
})
```

## Implementation Insights

During implementation, several key insights emerged that refined the original design:

### 1. Middleware Pattern Adjustment

The original design used `isAnyOf()` matcher, but the final implementation uses `actionCreator` for better type safety:

```typescript
// Final implementation
storageSanitizationMiddleware.startListening({
  actionCreator: setText,
  effect: (action, listenerApi) => {
    // Process and sanitize
  },
})
```

### 2. Character Sanitizer Complexity

The character sanitizer required careful cursor position tracking across multiple regex replacements. The final implementation collects all matches first, then calculates cursor adjustments:

```typescript
// Collect matches before applying replacements
for (const matchInfo of matches) {
  if (matchInfo.index < adjustedCursorPos) {
    cursorAdjustment += matchInfo.replacement.length - matchInfo.length
  }
}
```

### 3. List Enter Handling

The list enter logic remained in the component layer since it's inherently tied to keyboard events. The sanitization system focuses on text processing rather than event handling.

### 4. Test Integration

All existing tests were preserved and updated to work with the new system, ensuring backward compatibility while adding comprehensive character sanitizer tests.

### 5. Directory Structure (Implemented)

The final directory structure:

```

   - Direct sanitization removed from component logic
   - UI-specific logic preserved

### 5. Testing Strategy

Tests in this project are written using Bun's test framework (bun:test).

The testing strategy needs to maintain and extend the existing comprehensive test coverage while adding new tests for the sanitization system.

#### Existing Tests to Preserve

1. Editor slice tests (`editorSlice.test.ts`)

   - Basic text operations (setText, clear, load)
   - Unicode character handling
   - Cursor position management
   - Multiple document operations
   - Rapid consecutive operations

2. Visual indent tests (`visualIndent.test.ts`)

   - Stripping and injecting indentation
   - Cursor position adjustments
   - Edge cases and special characters

3. List enter tests (`computeListEnter.test.ts`)
   - List item handling
   - Cursor positioning
   - Various list formats

#### New Tests Required

1. Storage Stage Tests:

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/storage/__tests__/pipeline.test.ts
describe('Storage Sanitization Pipeline', () => {
  it('cleans problematic characters before storage', () => {})
  it('maintains cursor position after cleaning', () => {})
  it('processes sanitizers in correct order', () => {})
  it('handles empty text correctly', () => {})
})
```

2. Presentation Stage Tests:

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/presentation/__tests__/pipeline.test.ts
describe('Presentation Transform Pipeline', () => {
  it('applies visual transformations correctly', () => {})
  it('handles cursor positions in transformed text', () => {})
  it('processes transformers in correct order', () => {})
})
```

3. Integration Tests:

```typescript
// src/editor/sanitization/__tests__/integration.test.ts
describe('Sanitization Integration', () => {
  it('correctly handles text from input to display', () => {})
  it('preserves cursor through entire pipeline', () => {})
  it('maintains list formatting through storage and display', () => {})
})
```

### 6. Quality Checks (Completed)

All quality checks passed during implementation:

1. **Type Checking**

   ```bash
   bun run typecheck
   ```

   ✅ No new type errors introduced

   bun run test
   ```

   ✅ All existing tests pass (209 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail)
   ✅ New character sanitizer tests with comprehensive coverage
   ✅ Both success and error cases tested

4. **Manual Testing Results**
   - ✅ Various input methods work (type, paste, load)
   - ✅ Cursor behavior correct in all scenarios
   - ✅ List formatting and indentation preserved
